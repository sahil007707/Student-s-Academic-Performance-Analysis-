# 🎓 Student's Academic Performance Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis and visualization project that explores the impact of various factors—like gender, study time, failures, internet access, and more—on students' academic performance. This project is ideal for understanding student behavior and performance trends using data science techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze student academic data and extract meaningful insights regarding:

- The distribution of final grades
- Influence of demographic and lifestyle factors
- Correlation between study habits and performance
- Recommendations for improving student success

## 📈 Key Insights

✔️ Students with **higher study time** tend to score better  
✔️ **Internet access** and **family support** show noticeable impact on performance  
✔️ **Failures in past classes** negatively correlate with final grades  
✔️ Male and female students show different performance patterns across features

---

## 📊 Visualizations

Some of the visualizations used in the notebook include:

- Grade distribution histograms
- Correlation heatmaps
- Boxplots of study time vs grades
- Comparative analysis by gender, parental education, and more

> 📌 PCA and clustering can also be applied to uncover student group patterns *(optional extension)*

## 🧪 Sample Code Snippet

```python
# Correlation heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title("Correlation Between Academic Factors and Final Grades")
plt.show()
